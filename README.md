## Packages üì¶

For the user, first, he deposits 50% to mint NFT.

`TODO change parts`

- [App](./packages/app) - Frontend
- [Contracts](./packages/hardhat/) - Liquidity smartcontracts
- [Ustc_plus](./packages/ustc_plus/) - Ustc+ smartcontract.

The USTC+ smartcontract is based on LayerZero which in turn based on old Hardhat packages.
Meanwhile, the Liquidity smartcontracts are based on the most recent version of Hardhat and Openzeppelin Upgradeables.
The recent hardhat used by openzeppelin upgradeables and layerzero are not compatible, therefore we made two separate packages.

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

1, Download and install all dependencies. This line of code in the terminal is executed only once.

```bash
yarn install
```

2, Register on [Cloud.WalletConnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and get the project ID.
Create `app/.env` file based on `app/.env.sample`.
In the `app/.env` set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` to the project ID that you obtained from the WalletConnect cloud.

3, Run the website on your laptop and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel üö¢

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%ustc-plus%2Fcore)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=nexth&filter=next.js&utm_source=nexth&utm_campaign=nexth-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

During project setup, don't forget to set the environment variables that you set on `app/.env`.

## Adding a support of a new network

### Frontend

First, update the abis on frontend by calling

`yarn run wagmi` and `yarn run wagmi --config ./ustc_wagmi.config.ts`

Then, copy the values of `packages/app/src/abis.ts` to `packages/backend/src/abis.ts`.
In the `packages/backend/src/abis.ts` and remove wagmi import in the top and everything after `ACTION` comment.

Finally, add the support of the networks on `packages/app/src/utils/networks.ts`

### Backend

On backend, create `RPC_URL_<chain_id>` environment variable and put the RPC node.
create `SIGNER_KEY_<chain_id>` environment variable and set the private key of the signer.

Then, open the `packages/backend/src/services/Blockchain.ts` and add the supported providers, ethers clients.
